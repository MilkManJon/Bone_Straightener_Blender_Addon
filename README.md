# Bone_Straightener_Blender_Addon
This is a blender addon that straightens all of the selected bones while in edit mode. 
This addon was specifically made for creating rigged models for Modded licensed games by Heavy Iron Studios, but you can use this for whatever purpose you like.  
__How to use:__

There are two checkboxes, one for disconnecting bones from eachother and another for shrinking the bones.

The first checkbox is checked automatically, as the bone's won't stay at their proper places otherwise. Note that this only disconnects the bones, not unparents them.  
The other checkbox is labelled as "Shrinking Bones to Heavy Iron's size" and this is because if you exported a rigged model from one of Heavy Iron's games, the bones were always .05 meters in length. It also can declutter the model if a bunch of the bones are really close to each other.

Of course you have to hit "Straighten Bones" to you know, do that. Though make sure to have all the bones selected
